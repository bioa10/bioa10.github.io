<p>You have recieved a letter from Lord Redspar.

	"Greetings young adventurers!
	I am Gerald Redspar and I happened
	to come upon your name while looking
	for newer adventurers trying to make
	a name for themselves. I have a
	simple request and was hoping that
	you would be able to help me out
	in return for a small reward and
	some reputation for your work."
	
Below it lists an address near the southern end of King's Port and a request to meet him there tomorrow morning.

Lord Redspar is an old retired hero of Valusia and he has hung up his magical sword Dragon's Tooth many years ago as he had no sons to give it to. You know that helping him is sure to increase your reputation and get your foot in the door to adventuring.
</p>
